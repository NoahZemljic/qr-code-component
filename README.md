## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I forgot that in order to have a height of 100% on the body, I first need to set that on the HTML ðŸ˜…. Good thing I found that out ðŸ˜„.

### Continued development

My plan is to continue gaining knowledge in the realm of front-end development, as well as learn and implement best practices.

### Useful resources

- [Weekend Projects](https://weekendprojects.dev/posts/how-to-fix-css-height-100-not-working/#steps-to-take-to-fix-height-100-not-working-issues) - At first I couldn't get the body to take up 100% of the page's height. I think using 100vh is not a good solution, so I tried this out.
